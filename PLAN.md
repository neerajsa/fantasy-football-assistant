# Fantasy Football Draft Assistant - Development Plan

## Iterative Development Plan

Here's a 7-phase iterative plan to build the Fantasy Football Draft Assistant, starting with Draft Configuration:

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure**
- Set up virtual environment and install dependencies (FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL drivers)
- Create basic project structure with backend/frontend separation
- Configure PostgreSQL database with Docker for local development
- Set up basic API routing and React app scaffolding

### **Phase 2: Draft Configuration Feature** ‚≠ê *Starting Point*
- Create backend models for draft settings (scoring, draft type, positions, teams)
- Build FastAPI endpoints to save/retrieve draft configurations
- Develop React UI components for configuration form with Chakra UI
- Implement validation for all configuration options (4-32 teams, position counts, etc.)

### **Phase 3: Player Data Foundation**
- Design database schema for players and rankings
- Create data models for player information and rankings
- Build initial data aggregation scripts to pull from public sources
- Populate database with basic player data for testing

### **Phase 4: Mock Draft Simulator Core** ‚≠ê *Current Phase*

#### **4.1: Draft Engine Backend (High Priority)**
- **Draft State Management**: Create models to track draft state, turn order, picks made
- **Turn Logic**: Implement snake/linear draft turn calculation and validation
- **Draft Session**: Build session management for active drafts
- **Pick Validation**: Ensure picks are valid (player available, correct turn, etc.)

#### **4.2: Interactive Draft Board UI (High Priority)**
- **Real-time Draft Board**: Live updating grid showing all picks
- **Player Search/Filter**: Advanced filtering by position, ranking, team
- **User Pick Interface**: Intuitive player selection with recommendations
- **Draft Progress**: Visual indicators of draft status and whose turn

#### **4.3: Frontend-Backend Integration (High Priority)**
- **WebSocket Connection**: Real-time updates for draft state changes
- **API Integration**: Connect draft actions to backend endpoints
- **State Management**: React state for draft board and player data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues and invalid picks

#### **4.4: AI Bot System (High Priority)**
- **Bot Logic**: Create intelligent draft bots with varying strategies
- **Decision Algorithm**: Implement best-player-available with positional needs
- **Realistic Behavior**: Add variance to make bots feel human-like
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure quick bot picks for smooth UX

#### **4.5: Supporting Infrastructure (Medium Priority - Stretch Goal)**
- **Database Migrations**: Add draft-specific tables and relationships
- **Enhanced Player Data**: More comprehensive stats for better recommendations
- **Testing Framework**: Unit tests for draft logic and API endpoints

### **Phase 5: AI Recommendations System**
- Develop recommendation engine considering BPA, positional needs, and scarcity
- Integrate recommendation system into mock draft interface
- Add real-time updates as draft progresses and roster composition changes

### **Phase 6: Live Draft Aid**
- Adapt draft interface for manual entry mode
- Build draft board for tracking all team picks
- Integrate same recommendation engine for live drafts
- Add real-time player availability updates

### **Phase 7: Post-Draft Analysis**
- Implement team grading algorithms and analysis logic
- Create detailed analysis UI showing grades, projections, and insights
- Add pick-by-pick analysis and alternative suggestions
- Build sleeper/top player identification features

## Current Status
- **Phase 1-3: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
- **Phase 4: IN PROGRESS** üöß 
  - Priority order: 4.1 ‚Üí 4.2 ‚Üí 4.3 ‚Üí 4.4 ‚Üí 4.5 (stretch goal)

## Notes
Each phase builds on the previous, with Phase 2 (Draft Configuration) providing the foundation that all other features will depend on. Phase 4 represents the core draft simulation functionality that users will interact with most.
