# Fantasy Football Draft Assistant - Development Plan

## Iterative Development Plan

Here's a 7-phase iterative plan to build the Fantasy Football Draft Assistant, starting with Draft Configuration:

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure**
- Set up virtual environment and install dependencies (FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL drivers)
- Create basic project structure with backend/frontend separation
- Configure PostgreSQL database with Docker for local development
- Set up basic API routing and React app scaffolding

### **Phase 2: Draft Configuration Feature** ‚≠ê *Starting Point*
- Create backend models for draft settings (scoring, draft type, positions, teams)
- Build FastAPI endpoints to save/retrieve draft configurations
- Develop React UI components for configuration form with Chakra UI
- Implement validation for all configuration options (4-32 teams, position counts, etc.)

### **Phase 3: Player Data Foundation**
- Design database schema for players and rankings
- Create data models for player information and rankings
- Build initial data aggregation scripts to pull from public sources
- Populate database with basic player data for testing

### **Phase 4: Mock Draft Simulator Core**
- Implement draft engine with turn management and snake/linear logic
- Create AI bot system for opponent draft picks
- Build interactive draft board UI with player filtering/sorting
- Connect frontend draft interface to backend draft engine

### **Phase 5: AI Recommendations System**
- Develop recommendation engine considering BPA, positional needs, and scarcity
- Integrate recommendation system into mock draft interface
- Add real-time updates as draft progresses and roster composition changes

### **Phase 6: Live Draft Aid**
- Adapt draft interface for manual entry mode
- Build draft board for tracking all team picks
- Integrate same recommendation engine for live drafts
- Add real-time player availability updates

### **Phase 7: Post-Draft Analysis**
- Implement team grading algorithms and analysis logic
- Create detailed analysis UI showing grades, projections, and insights
- Add pick-by-pick analysis and alternative suggestions
- Build sleeper/top player identification features

## Notes
Each phase builds on the previous, with Phase 2 (Draft Configuration) providing the foundation that all other features will depend on.
